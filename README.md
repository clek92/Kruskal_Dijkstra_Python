# Kruskal_Dijkstra_Python
A university project which required an implementation of Kruskal and Djikstra algorithms in any programming language <br>
The chosen programming language was python and the requirement was to create 4 different graphs with different maximum weights (10,25,50,100)<br>
Each graph should be executed 5 times <br>
It consists of three files and the comments in each file are in Greek language <br>
**Files**
1) graphs.py Creates the graphs in the form of adjacency matrices and stores each matrix in 2 ways npy file, and excel xlsx file. 
2) kruskal_adj.py The implementation of the Kruskal algorithm in order to find Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
3) Dijkstra_path.py The implementation of Dijkstra algorithm in order to find the shortest path it print the result in the form Vertex , Distance from source, Path
